          'We hired Jeff in 2010 to take over development of our RoR based vehicle tracking application. Over the next few years he proved to be highly productive, enhancing the application in multiple ways that helped fuel our rapid growth. Over the years as our team grew he worked well with others and contributed wherever he was needed. Jeff likes to stay busy and learn new things , often telling me of the projects he worked on over the weekend exploring new technologies. In the last couple of years, after being acquired by GTC Communications, I have had less to do with his day to day activities but I know he continued to be a valued member of the team. With his exemplary work ethic, productivity and ability to work with minimal direction, Jeff would be an asset to any organization.\n',

          "I worked with Jeff at intouchgps for three years. Jeff and I were co-workers working on Ruby on Rails projects and later AWS cloud projects. You won't find a more dedicated programmer. Jeff rarely took a day off and often worked weekends. He has a passion for programming. Jeff was often asked to take on multiple tasks with high-pressure deadlines. He single-handedly built most of the core systems at intouchgps.com. Jeff is constantly trying to improve his craft by studying. He has on more than one occasion provided me with excellent learning material for my own professional growth. I really enjoyed working with Jeff on both a professional and personal level. Should you require additional information please feel free to get my personal contact information from Jeff and contact me directly. ",
